CSE 4381 - InfoSec 2
Due 04/30/2021

This project is for the completion of assignment 3 for CSE 4381 under professor Levine.

The goal of this project was to demonstrate information security knowledge through a "website" like platform. 
The website was created through Flask/Python in a venv.

Steps to run locally:
Navigate inside the flask_auth_app folder in your cmd.
-- For your first time setup --
Run venv\Scripts\Activate
-- Every Other Time --
Run .\auth\Scripts\Activate
Run set FLASK_APP=project
Run flask run

The site will be run at localhost:5000

Of course this will not allow you do to anything database related (basically everything) but it will
allow you to see the pretty login page.
